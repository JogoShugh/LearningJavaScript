LearningJavaScript
==================

Code Samples collected while learning JavaScript

This will contain code examples that help teach JavaScript. For now, it's based on the excellent book [Eloquent JavaScript -- A Modern Introduction to Programming](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) by Marijn Haverbeke.

In many cases the examples will refer to examples from his book and give chapter and exercise reference. They are intended to expand on his examples with further detail as I help people learn the language and discover new things about it myself.
